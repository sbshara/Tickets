# Ticketing System 

using Laravel


## Versioning

Ticketing is versioned under the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines.

Releases will be numbered with the following format:

`<major>.<minor>.<patch>`

And constructed with the following guidelines:

* Breaking backward compatibility bumps the major and resets the minor and patch.
* New additions without breaking backward compatibility bumps the minor and resets the patch.
* Bug fixes and misc changes bumps the patch.

Minor versions are not maintained individually, and you're encouraged to upgrade through to the next minor version.

Major versions are maintained individually through separate branches.

Each complete release would be stored in a seperate branch using the Major & Minor version as the branch name.  Master branch would mirror the latest version.
